# Guardian 2

This is a sequel to my 1983 game, [Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItddIniQh_k),
which was originally written for the Radio Shack Color Computer. It's loosely inspired by
various side-scrolling arcade shooters of that era.

The game has been re-written in Rust using the Bevy game engine.
